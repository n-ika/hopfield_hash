# Hopfield networks storing hashed inputs

Hopfield networks with hashing in two versions:

* Hopfield, J. J. (1982). Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective computational abilities. Proceedings of the national academy of sciences, 79(8), 2554-2558.
* Dayan, P., & Abbott, L. F. (2001). Theoretical neuroscience: computational and mathematical modeling of neural systems. Computational Neuroscience Series.

## Dependencies:
The scripts are written for Python 3.7.

* jupyter notebook: `pip install jupyterlab` [https://jupyter.org/install]
* numpy: `pip install numpy` [https://numpy.org/install/]
* librosa: `pip install librosa` [https://librosa.org/]
* python_speech_features: `pip install python_speech_features` [https://github.com/jameslyons/python_speech_features]
* scipy: `pip install scipy` [https://scipy.org/install.html]
* matplotlib: `pip install matplotlib`[https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/users/installing.html]
* glob: `pip install glob3`


## Note:

Move the `.wav` files you wish to use with these scripts into *./wavs* folder or modify the path in `folder_train = "./wavs/"`.
